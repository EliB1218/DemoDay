        <h3> Throughout the Covid pandemic, it has been safer to social distance in order to reduce risk of infection. However, the effects isolation takes on the human mind has lead to a wave of mental health issues in the world. To add insult to injury, survivors of Covid often don't fully recover, making things quite difficult for them. Our mission is to bring resources to these people suffering through mental and physical problems during this covid crisis. </h3>
